1. Elevator service
In this exercises you need to look at the following table and recreate this with SQL code.
You can choose how you want to do it with whatever tool you would like. E.g MySQL
workbench, Python connector or SQLite etcâ€¦ its up to you.
I would suggest that you work with one class member as well.. Have a discussion and make a
plan on how to tackle the problem.
Good luck!
